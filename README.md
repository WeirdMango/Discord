# Discord
A Simple way to send messages to discord servers in a timed manner

# HOW TO
Firstly, to get the channel id, go on the web version of discord and find the channel you want to spam on
Secondly, you want to copy the last part of the url
For example if it was https://discord.com/channels/302094807046684672/302094807046684672
You'd copy the last part, the "302094807046684672" part and paste it in
(developer mode) If you're on developer mode simply just right click the channel in the category it is in, right click the copy channel id and paste it where asked!

**To Get the token for your account,** Open inspect elements, (CTRL+SHIFT+I OR RIGHT CLICK AND SELECT INSPECT ELEMENTS). and go to the network tab (on the top).
Now you want to send a message with the network tab open, you should see something appear. It should be named "messages"
Scroll down till you see a bold "**REQUEST HEADERS**" keep an eye because inside the request headers there is a header called "authorization" you need to copy the string after the "authorization" 
and now paste it in where the code asks for authorization!
***NEVER GIVE YOUR TOKEN TO ANYBODY***
