# Discord
A Simple way to send messages to discord servers in a timed manner

# HOW TO
**To Get the token for your account,** Open inspect elements, (CTRL+SHIFT+I OR RIGHT CLICK AND SELECT INSPECT ELEMENTS). and go to the network tab (on the top).
Now you want to send a message with the network tab open, you should see something appear. It should be named "messages"
Scroll down till you see a bold "**REQUEST HEADERS**" keep an eye because inside the request headers there is a header called "authorization" you need to copy the string after the "authorization" 
and now paste it in where the code asks for authorization!
***NEVER GIVE YOUR TOKEN TO ANYBODY***
To get the channel id you want to scroll up on the original place where you found the token and you should see a request url, copy that url and paste it in!
