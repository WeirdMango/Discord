<br />
If you see on the top, you need to click the "Network" Tab.
<br />
Once you're there, send a message to your friend, and you should see something pop up, it should look like ![this](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69760274/111881173-cb2b2900-89c8-11eb-9956-1189663ef7ba.png), The one you want to click on is called "messages"
<br />
You should see at the very top, Something called Request URL: ( ![Reference Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69760274/111881231-fca3f480-89c8-11eb-8f25-b3551836dd92.png) )
<br />
Where the Request URL is at, copy everything begging from the "h" all the end to the "s", put that in the program and then click submit (if the messages aren't appearing, Click it again.)

# EXCEPTIONS
The one listed in the github and the one in the release are seperate, the one in the github needs it's settings to be set directly in the code, however the one in the release 
<br />
requires input and is an exe as it does not require the code to be changed.
<br />
You need to have either the .exe or the .py file in the same directory as the folder you want to use for the script
